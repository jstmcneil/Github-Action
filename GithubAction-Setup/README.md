# Github Actions Setup
The GitHub actions setup should be relatively easy for United Application developers. Like TeamCity, there are two primary options for setup.
1. Duplicate an already set-up repository which includes the GitHub action files.
2. Retrofit an existing repository to include the GitHub action files.
The second option is also ideal for projects that already have GitHub actions configured.

## Duplicate Repository
Start by navigating to this [directory](https://github.ual.com/V838688/Policy-as-Code-GitHub-Action).
1. Click the "Use this template" button at the top of the page.
2. Name your new repository, and provide a description as you would normally.
That's it! Everything should be set-up for usage now.

## Retrofit Existing Repository
